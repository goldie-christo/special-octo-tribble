# Take Home Application

This small Python application will listen for HTTP requests and answer them with a message containing the request's path.

## Requirement

Python 3 is required to run this application, which is installed by default on many Operating Systems.

* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Run it

In a terminal, start the application by running the following command (Python 3 might be installed as `python3` instead of `python`)

```bash
python app.py
```

The application should now be listening on the port configured in the script.
